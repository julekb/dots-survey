# dots-survey

How to launch the survey:

1. Download the repository.
2. Download jsPsych library ( http://www.jspsych.org ) and add jspsych-similarity_modified.js. file to the directory /plugins. I worked on jspsych-5.0.3
3. File experiment.js is the place, where the survey can be managed. Instructions' cells should be personalized.
4. Script circles.py provides boards for the survey. They should be added in the directory img/dots.
